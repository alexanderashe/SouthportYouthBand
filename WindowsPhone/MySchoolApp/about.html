<h1>About</h1>
This application was created by <a href="http://cis.bentley.edu/mfrydenberg">Mark Frydenberg</a> at <a href="http://www.bentley.edu">Bentley University</a> to demonstrate features 
of Windows Phone 7 programming using Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Basic.net.  It was first demonstrated at the <a href="http://www.uspsciosummit.com/">
Microsoft US Public Sector CIO Summit </a>in February, 2011. 
<p>
The application is intended to be a template for educators at other colleges and universities to use as an example in their classrooms. 
By replacing the Bentley-specific information (logo, colors, URLs, sports team name, 
    and content information) in three XML files with your own, you can create a working app for your school. 
    Those who wish can also delve into the code to make additional modifications to 
    button labels, page titles, etc. This is an effective way to introduce Phone programming concepts to beginning students in application development courses.
